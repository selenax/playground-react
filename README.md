# playground-react – Dynamic Form Builder

This is an interactive form builder built in React, where users can create customizable form fields like Text, Checkbox, Select, and Paragraph — complete with editable labels, required toggles, and live previews.

I built this project to showcase my skills in:

- Component architecture and state management
- Dynamic rendering based on user-generated schemas
- Reusable UI with TailwindCSS and React
- Planning and scaling multi-step UI workflows

## What You Can Do

- Add fields with one click (Text, Checkbox, Paragraph, Select)
- Edit field labels and toggle required status
- See a live preview of how the form would look

Coming next:

- Option editing (add/remove choices in Select)
- Form validation and preview mode
- Local save/load support

## Tech Stack

- React + Vite
- TailwindCSS
- Functional components with hooks (`useState`, `map`, prop drilling)
- Conventional commit workflow + ESLint

This repo is part of my dev playground where I prototype and refine real-world features from scratch. Pinned to showcase component-driven thinking and frontend architecture beyond just visuals.
